# Introduction
This is a mini-game that is inspired by various good transport games, like the Port Royle and Patrician series. It has a overly simplistic logistics system that is roughly inspired by the Settlers 2. You have only 1 goal, as a space industrialist: to earn as much money as possible. May your action marks the start of a new industrial revolution, in space.
